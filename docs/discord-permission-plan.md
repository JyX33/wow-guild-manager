# Plan to Resolve Discord API Error 50001 (Missing Access)

**Context:** Encountering Discord API error 50001 ("Missing Access") when `postEventToDiscord` tries to create a thread via `channel.threads.create`. This indicates insufficient bot permissions.

**Goal:** Diagnose and resolve the permission issue to allow successful event posting to Discord threads.

**Detailed Plan:**

1. **Analyze the Error Context:**
    * **Error:** DiscordAPIError code `50001` ("Missing Access"), HTTP status `403` (Forbidden).
    * **Action:** `channel.threads.create` (Attempting to create a new thread).
    * **Location:** `backend/src/modules/discord/eventIntegration.ts`, line `41`.
    * **Target Channel:** The channel ID specified in the `process.env.DISCORD_EVENT_CHANNEL_ID` environment variable.
    * **Conclusion:** The bot associated with the application lacks the necessary permissions *in the specified channel* to create threads.

2. **Identify Required Discord Permissions:**
    * To create a public thread (`type: 11` used in the code corresponds to `ChannelType.PublicThread`) and post a message within it, the bot needs the following permissions *within the target channel*:
        * **View Channel:** To see and access the channel.
        * **Send Messages:** To interact with the channel (often a prerequisite for other actions).
        * **Create Public Threads:** To perform the `threads.create` action for public threads.
        * **Send Messages in Threads:** To post the initial event embed message into the newly created thread.

3. **Verify Current Bot Permissions:**
    * **Step 3.1:** Identify the Bot: Determine which Discord Bot User corresponds to your application instance.
    * **Step 3.2:** Identify the Channel: Confirm the exact Channel ID stored in `process.env.DISCORD_EVENT_CHANNEL_ID`. Find this channel within your Discord server.
    * **Step 3.3:** Check Server-Level Role Permissions:
        * Go to your Discord Server Settings > Roles.
        * Find the role(s) assigned to your bot.
        * Review the permissions granted to that role. Ensure the permissions listed in step 2 (`View Channel`, `Send Messages`, `Create Public Threads`, `Send Messages in Threads`) are enabled *at the server level*.
    * **Step 3.4:** Check Channel-Specific Permissions (Crucial):
        * Navigate to the target channel (identified in Step 3.2).
        * Right-click the channel name (or use the gear icon) and select "Edit Channel".
        * Go to the "Permissions" tab.
        * Under "Roles/Members", find the bot's role or the bot user itself if added directly.
        * Carefully check the permissions specifically for that role/user *within this channel*. Pay close attention to:
            * Explicit `Allow` settings (checkmark `✓`).
            * Explicit `Deny` settings (slash `/`). **Channel-specific Deny permissions override server-level Allow permissions.**
            * Inherited permissions (neutral slash `-`). If inherited, the effective permission comes from the server role settings checked in Step 3.3.
        * Confirm that *all* required permissions from Step 2 are effectively allowed (either explicitly allowed in the channel or allowed at the server level and not denied in the channel).

4. **Grant Missing Permissions (If Necessary):**
    * If Step 3 revealed missing permissions:
        * **Option A (Recommended for channel-specific needs):** In the Channel Permissions settings (Step 3.4), explicitly grant (`✓`) the missing required permissions (`View Channel`, `Send Messages`, `Create Public Threads`, `Send Messages in Threads`) to the bot's role or the bot user directly for that specific channel.
        * **Option B (If broader access is acceptable):** In the Server Settings > Roles (Step 3.3), grant the missing permissions to the bot's role server-wide. Ensure no channel-specific overrides are denying these permissions in the target channel.
    * Save the changes in Discord.

5. **Test the Functionality:**
    * Trigger the `postEventToDiscord` function again (e.g., by creating a new event in your application).
    * Monitor the application logs for the `50001` error.
    * Check the target Discord channel to see if the thread is created successfully.

6. **Potential Code Improvements (Optional but Recommended):**
    * **Enhanced Error Logging:** Modify the `catch` block in `postEventToDiscord` to specifically check for `DiscordAPIError` and log more targeted information if the code is `50001`:

        ```typescript
        // Inside the catch block (around line 80)
        } catch (error: any) { // Use 'any' or a more specific error type if available
            const channelId = process.env.DISCORD_EVENT_CHANNEL_ID; // Get channel ID again for logging
            if (error.code === 50001) { // DiscordAPIError often has a 'code' property
                logger.error(
                    { err: error, eventId: event.id, channelId: channelId },
                    `Failed to post event to Discord due to Missing Access (Permissions Issue) in channel ${channelId}. Please verify the bot has 'View Channel', 'Send Messages', 'Create Public Threads', and 'Send Messages in Threads' permissions in this channel.`
                );
            } else {
                logger.error(
                    { err: error, eventId: event.id, channelId: channelId },
                    `Failed to post event to Discord or update database for channel ${channelId}.`
                );
            }
            // Optional: Consider retry logic or notifying an admin
        }
        ```

    * **Startup Permission Check (Advanced):** Implement a check when the bot starts (e.g., in the `ready` event handler in `discordClient.js`) to fetch the target channel and verify the bot's permissions (`me.permissionsIn(channel)`) for the essential actions (`ViewChannel`, `SendMessages`, `CreatePublicThreads`, `SendMessagesInThreads`). Log a warning if permissions are insufficient during startup. This provides earlier feedback.
