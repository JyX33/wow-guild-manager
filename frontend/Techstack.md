# Frontend Tech Stack

This document outlines the technologies, libraries, and dependencies used in the WoW Guild Manager frontend application.

## Core Technologies

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project uses React for its component-based architecture and declarative programming model.
* **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It is used to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity through static typing.
* **Vite**: A fast frontend build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience. It is used for bundling, hot module replacement (HMR), and optimizing the build process.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is used for styling the application.

## Key Libraries and Dependencies

* **@tanstack/react-query**: A powerful data-fetching library for React applications. It is used for managing server state, caching, and synchronizing data with the backend API.
* **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It is used for making API requests to the backend.
* **formik**: A popular library for building forms in React. It simplifies form state management, validation, and submission.
* **yup**: A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. It is commonly used with Formik for defining form validation schemas.
* **date-fns**: A modern JavaScript date utility library.
* **moment**: A legacy JavaScript date library, potentially used for compatibility or specific features.
* **luxon**: A powerful, modern, and friendly wrapper for JavaScript dates and times.
* **react-big-calendar**: A flexible and highly customizable calendar component for React. It is likely used for displaying events or schedules.
* **react-router-dom**: DOM bindings for React Router, used for declarative routing in the application.

## Development Dependencies

* **@types/react**, **@types/react-dom**, **@types/node**: TypeScript type definitions for React, React DOM, and Node.js.
* **@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin**, **@typescript-eslint/parser**: ESLint plugins and parser for TypeScript, used for linting and enforcing coding standards.
* **eslint**: A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX. Used for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
* **eslint-plugin-react-hooks**: ESLint plugin for enforcing rules of React Hooks.
* **@vitejs/plugin-react**: A Vite plugin that provides React support.
* **bun** or **npm**: Package managers used for installing and managing project dependencies.

## Configuration Files

* `.env*`: Environment variable files for different environments (development, production, example).
* `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration file for defining linting rules.
* `bun.lock` / `package-lock.json`: Lock files generated by Bun and npm, respectively, to ensure consistent dependency versions.
* `package.json`: Project manifest file listing dependencies, scripts, and other project metadata.
* `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`: TypeScript configuration files for compiling TypeScript code.
* `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration file for customizing the build process and development server.
